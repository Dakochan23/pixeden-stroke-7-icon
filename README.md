###Features

 - **Scalable vector.** Our icons look crisp at any size and will shine in any high-resolution displays.
   
 - **Screen Readers compatible.** This icon font uses the Private Use Area of Unicode so that it will not trip up screen readers with weird
   symbols.
   
 - **Versatility with CSS.** Instantly customize your icons in size, color and any style available in CSS.
   
 - **Create your own.** You can import this icon font with a .json file into IcoMoon App font generator to mix and match with other fonts or
   select only the icons you need and generate a new font.
